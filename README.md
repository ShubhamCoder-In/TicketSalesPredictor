# Project Title: Ticket Sales Prediction Model

## Overview

This project involves predicting ticket sales using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains various features related to events, ticket sales, and their corresponding characteristics.

## Step 1: Download the Dataset

The dataset for this project is hosted on Google Drive. To download it, follow these steps:

1. **Open the URL in a web browser:**
   [Download Dataset](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/open?id=1aQhPO1yHMxuTMWvAonNvrYV4rGN-PRjp&authuser=0)

2. **Click on the download button** on the Google Drive page to save the file to your local machine.

3. **Rename the downloaded file** to `recode.csv` for consistency with the project code.

## Step 2: Setup the Environment

To run the project, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following contents:

```plaintext
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Python:** Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Use the following command to install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Step 3: Load the Dataset

Once you have the dataset downloaded and the environment set up, you can load the dataset using Pandas. Below is an example of how to do this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('recode.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
```

## Step 4: Train the Model

After loading the dataset, you can train a machine learning model using the following code snippet:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error

# Prepare features (X) and target variable (y)
X = data[['capacity', 'days_until_event', 'hours_until_event']]  # Example features
y = data['sold_tickets']  # Example target variable

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}')
print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae:.2f}')
```

## Conclusion

Follow the above steps to download the dataset, set up your environment, and train a machine learning model for ticket sales prediction. Make sure to customize the feature selection and target variable according to the actual dataset you are working with.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your Python environment is activated if you are using virtual environments (like venv or conda).
- If you encounter any issues, please check the Python and library versions.
- Feel free to modify the model parameters for better performance based on your specific needs.
